## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Install necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Repository Structure
Navigate through the repository to explore different modules:
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Holds trained models.
- `scripts/`: Contains executable scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and EDA.
- `results/`: Outputs of training and testing, including visualizations and metrics.
- `tests/`: Unit tests to validate the functionality of scripts and models.

### Run the Project
1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
   ```
3. Classify emails:
   ```bash
   python scripts/classify_email.py --input "sample_email.txt"
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py
   ```
